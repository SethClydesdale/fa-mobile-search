# Forumotion Mobile Search

This plugin is meant to install an AJAX search function for the mobile version. As the mobile version lacks an ability to search, this should completely improve the experience. Allowing you to quickly search topics, posts, and more..

## Installing

To install this plugin go to **Admin Panel > Modules > JavaScript codes management** and create a new script with the following settings.

**Title :** Mobile Search

**Placement :** In all the pages

Then paste the [raw source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SethClydesdale/fa-mobile-search/master/mobile-search.js) into the textarea and submit. Once done, you should now have a new button in the mobile toolbar that allows you to initiate searches from anywhere on the forum. A more indepth tutorial will be created soon. :)

The result should be similar to the example below :
